//
//   * SET (here)    -- write our values once, when nothing else is writing.
//                      This is what makes "configure it before launching a
//                      game" work at all.
//   * DEFEND (patch) -- correct a game that later overwrites them.
//
// Neither covers the other's case. A setting a game never touches only needs
// SET; a setting a game writes needs both.

// device is attached to Windows, so nothing else is writing to the controller
// at that moment.

// ⭐ ON A CABLE AND OVER BLUETOOTH ALIKE (code review, 2026-10-05). The report
// is built in its USB form, 0x02, and goes out through the session's map the
// way the host's own output does: verbatim on a cable, reshaped and signed as
// a 0x31 over Bluetooth.
// ⛔ This used to say WIRED ONLY and send the report straight to the backend,
// but nothing kept a Bluetooth pad out: the gate below is the pad's ids, which
// are the same on both. So a Bluetooth DualSense was sent a raw 0x02, which it
// ignores, and its mic mute, trigger effects and routing never took.
//
// Field positions and claim bits below are our own, from on-wire capture, and
// were independently cross-checked against daidr/dualsense-tester (MIT) --
// every position and bit agreed. NO CODE WAS COPIED.
//
// !! We deliberately DIVERGE from that project on one VALUE. Its "route to
// !! speaker" command clears echo cancellation. Measured on 2026-07-31: the
// !! controller mutes its own speaker when echo cancellation is off, because
// !! the microphone sits beside it. We route to the speaker AND keep echo
// !! cancellation on. Use that project for positions, not for audio values.
