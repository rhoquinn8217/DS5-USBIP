// The words on the tray icon's menu, and the order they come in.
//
// ⭐ WHAT THE MENU IS (rhoquinn8217, 2026-10-02, in their order):
//
//     DS5-USBIP                      a title, larger and bold; choosing it
//     2 devices connected            closes the menu. A count under it
//     ----------------------------
//     Devices                    >   one line per device; choosing one opens
//     ----------------------------   the Controller Configs window on it
//     Open Controller Configs
//     Open Virtual Keyboard
//     ----------------------------
//     Window Mode                >   Advanced, Simple, Quick, with the
//     ----------------------------   padlock on the one the window is in
//     Quit
//
// ⓘ Quit was not in the order they gave. It is the only way the listener is
// closed, so it stays, last, under a break of its own.
//
// ⭐ THE WINDOW IS "CONTROLLER CONFIGS" (rhoquinn8217, 2026-10-03). "Config"
// meant the window, the saved set a pad is linked to and the folder at once;
// a config stays a config, and the window that holds them is named for them.
// ⓘ And its layout is "Window Mode": the side menu was "Config Mode", the
// two words that inside the listener name the state in which a pad drives
// the page instead of the game. In code and in the log the layout is still
// called the VIEW or the mode of the window.
//
// ⭐ DEVICES, NOT CONTROLLERS, AND NOT THEIR PARTS (rhoquinn8217, 2026-10-02:
// *"Multiple devices with the same name should count as 1 device in the tray
// menu and there should only be 1 controller entry for that device"* and *"in
// the tray menu change controllers to devices."*). A keyboard-and-mouse
// receiver bridged as three parts was three lines and three in the count.
//
// ⭐ Pure on purpose -- no Windows call -- so the test binary includes it as it
// is. tray_icon.inl builds the menu from these and does the drawing.
