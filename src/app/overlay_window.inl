// The overlay window.
//
// ⭐ WHAT IT IS FOR. An on-screen keyboard that a bridged controller can drive
// while a GAME keeps focus. Steam's keyboard cannot be navigated by our pad --
// a rebound button is stripped before Steam sees it -- and the Windows touch
// keyboard ignores our bridged DS5 entirely (measured 2026-08-31). The TV has a
// usable keyboard of its own, but using it means TV-side code, a protocol
// message and an upstream merge; the bridge contributed upstream is meant to
// stay THIN, so
// anything solved here is TV-side code never written.
//
// ⛔ IT MUST NEVER TAKE FOCUS. That is the whole point: the game keeps focus and
// keeps receiving the keystrokes we synthesise. WS_EX_NOACTIVATE is what makes
// that structural rather than something we have to remember.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT CANNOT WORK OVER AN EXCLUSIVE-FULLSCREEN GAME. "Always on top" is a
// hint to the desktop compositor about stacking order; an exclusive-fullscreen
// game bypasses the compositor and paints the display directly, so there is no
// stack for the hint to act on. Borderless windowed works -- which is why every
// overlay you have ever used works there and nowhere else. Do not spend time
// trying to beat this; document it.
//
// ⓘ THIS FILE IS STEP ONE OF TWO. It draws a placeholder with plain GDI, on
// purpose: the question worth answering first is whether a window with these
// styles behaves over the games actually played, and that question needs no
// browser. WebView2 replaces the painting once the window is proven, and if the
// window is NOT proven we will not have spent anything on a rendering engine.

// ⭐⭐ THE TAB (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-02). The window's frame is four pixels
// wide, which is a poor thing to aim at with a remote -- so the three functions
// that act on the KEYBOARD ITSELF get a strip of their own above it, with a
// wide grab area beside them.
//
// ⓘ Shared by both faces: they are the same three buttons whichever keys are
// below, and one table means they cannot drift apart.
//
// ⛔ The spacer is most of the width on purpose. It is the handle.
// ⭐⭐ SUB-COMPACT (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-02). Compact with every symbol and
// punctuation mark taken out -- letters, digits and the keys a controller
// cannot reach.
//
// ⓘ For typing a name or a search term, where , . / [ ] \ ; ' are dead weight
// and every column of them is a column of travel.
// ⭐⭐ TEN EQUAL COLUMNS, FOR A CONTROLLER (rhoquinn8217, 2026-10-03). Close
// is Circle, and tab, esc and del went with the column they stood in. The
// digits sit straight over q a z, shift starts the bottom letter row and up
// and fn end it, and the bottom row is ctrl, win, alt, a two-key space,
// backspace, paste and the arrows.
// ⓘ Backspace stays a key although Square does it, and space although
// Triangle does: each wears its button's symbol, so the key teaches the
// shortcut, as the Steam Deck's and Windows' pad keyboards do.
// ⭐⭐ AND FN BRINGS THE REST BACK, as a layer rather than as keys:
//   - 1 to 0 are F1 to F10, and q and w are F11 and F12;
//   - twenty-two letters are the symbols the face has no key for, near where
//     a full keyboard has them around enter: ' " and ; : on h j k l, \ |
//     on o p above enter, - _ = + [ ] on e to i, , . / ? on v b n m with < >
//     on x c, and ` ~ { } on s d f g;
//   - a is esc and z is tab; up and down are page up and page down, left is
//     del and right is home; paste is copy.
// ⛔ THE SHIFTED SYMBOLS WERE MISSING HERE (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-04). Every
// digit had `nullptr` where FULL and COMPACT carry L"!" and the rest -- that
// second field IS the shifted label, so shift had nothing to show or type and
// the row simply did not respond. ⓘ Sub-compact has no punctuation row, which
// makes these the only way to reach these symbols on that face.
