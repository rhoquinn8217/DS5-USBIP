//
// No code is copied from upstream; nothing here has an upstream counterpart.
//
// Why it exists: the log records that a session ended, but not when, not how
// long it had lived, and not what happened while nothing was being watched.
// A session that vanishes ~15 s after its last input hit the idle rule; one
// that vanishes ~30 s after hit the keepalive. The lived_ms figure on the
// "session gone" line is what separates them.
//
// Cadence: the agent loop's select() has a 1 s timeout but returns early on
// discovery traffic, so this runs at least once a second and often more. That
// is harmless -- it prints only when something changed -- and all timing comes
// from GetTickCount64(), never from counting passes.

// !! keeps the backend alive until this loop is done with it, and a backend
// !! stopped meanwhile refuses the send ("bridge socket closed", or the ENet
// !! peer gone), which is safe.

// A stall here delays the agent loop -- no new sessions, no reaps -- until the
// send returns. That is the least-bad place for it: one thread waiting rather
