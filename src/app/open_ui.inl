// Opening the settings page.
//
// WHY THE EXE DOES THIS. The launcher script used to open the page every time
// it started, and the listener stops on every build -- so a few rebuilds left a
// pile of identical browser windows lying around. Doing it here means the check
// for "one is already open" happens in the same place as the launch, which a
// batch file cannot do reliably.
//
// ⭐ REUSE IS BY WINDOW TITLE. Chrome offers no way to say "focus my app window
// if it exists"; --user-data-dir shares a profile but still opens a second
// window. So this walks the top-level windows looking for the page's own title
// and brings that one forward instead.
//
// ⚠️ That makes the page's <title> load-bearing. If it changes, this stops
// matching and the old behaviour returns -- a new window each time. The marker
// below is deliberately a fragment rather than the whole title so a version
// suffix or a trailing app name does not break it.

// Is a listener already running on the control port?

// every combination of "listener up or not" and "page open or not". Without
// this the second launch dies on a bind error and never reaches the page --
// the case where you most wanted it.
//
// ⛔ CONNECTS rather than binds. A bind probe was tried first and reported the
// port FREE while the agent held it: the agent binds INADDR_ANY, the probe
// bound loopback, and Windows permits that combination. Connecting asks the
// question directly -- is something accepting on this port -- and has no such
// ambiguity.
//
// ⚠️ Loopback only. A listener on another machine is not this one, and probing
// beyond the local host would be both wrong and slow.
