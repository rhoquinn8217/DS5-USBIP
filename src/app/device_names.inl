// What a bridged device is called, wherever a person reads its name.
//
// ⭐ ONE TABLE, AND IT IS THE LISTENER'S. The settings page worked this out for
// itself -- which model a kind names, and whether it arrived over USB or
// Bluetooth -- and that was fine while the page was the only place a device
// was named. The tray icon's menu lists the devices too, and the menu belongs
// to the listener. Two tables naming one thing drift apart, so the page asks
// for the name now (`label`, in each device of /api/v1/devices) and keeps no
// table of its own.
//
// ⛔ THE KIND STRINGS READ BACKWARDS, and that is not fixable here: "ds5" is a
// DualSense on BLUETOOTH, and the cabled one carries the _usb suffix. The TV
// sends them, so renaming would be a change to two repos' protocol rather
// than a rename. This file is where they are turned into words.
//
// ⓘ USB or Bluetooth is how the device reaches the TELEVISION, and it is in
// the kind for a DualSense, an Edge and a DualShock 4 only. For anything else
// it comes from the bus the TV sends at HELLO (code review, 2026-10-05), and
// when that is not known either the name says nothing rather than guess.
//
// ⭐ Pure on purpose -- no Windows call, no session -- so the test binary
// includes it as it is.
