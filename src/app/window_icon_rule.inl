// line -- another program's window, icon handles, messages -- so nothing in it
// can be tested without a desktop and a browser. The two RULES below are the
// part that can be wrong SILENTLY: an icon made at the wrong size is exactly
// the blur this exists to remove, and a window matched too loosely puts our
// icon on somebody's own browser.
// ⓘ The same split window_size_rule.inl makes for the window's size.
//
// ⛔ NOTHING HERE MAY INCLUDE windows.h, or the point of the split is lost.

// which is "100%", and they grow with it: 48 and 24 at 150%, 56 and 28 at
// 175%, 80 and 40 at 250%.
//
// ⛔ NOT GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXICON). That answers for the PRIMARY display,
// and the settings window may be sitting on another one at another scale.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY SIZE THIS CAN ANSWER FOR A STOCK SCALE IS A FRAME IN THE ICON,
// drawn for that size by installer\make-icon-ds5.ps1. Take a frame out there
// and Windows quietly stretches a neighbour to fit, which is the blur again at
// that one scale and nowhere else.

// ⭐ IS THIS TITLE OUR APP WINDOW'S, and not a browser tab showing the page?
//
// The page puts the marker on the end of its own title when it was opened with
// ?app. In the window WE open (--app=) the page's title is the whole window
// title, so the marker is the END of it. An ordinary browser window showing
// the same page in a tab reads "... [ctm-app] - Google Chrome": the marker is
// there, and something follows it.
//
// ⛔ FINDING THE WINDOW ASKS THIS TOO, since the code review of 2026-10-05
// (open_ui.inl). It used to ask only whether the marker was anywhere in the
// title, which found an ordinary browser window holding the page in a tab,
// and closing "our" window then closed that whole browser. An icon put on
// someone's own browser window would be the same fault on their taskbar.
