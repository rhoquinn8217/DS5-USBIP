    //
    // ⛔ There is no stock icon to ask for by name: shell32's indices are
    // undocumented and shift between releases, and Windows 11 moved the shell
    // icons into imageres.dll.mun entirely. Picking an index would be a guess
    // that silently becomes the wrong picture on some machine.

    // ⭐ ddores.dll is Windows' DEVICE icon library, and #108 is its gamepad:
    // a white silhouette that stays crisp all the way down to 16px, which is
    // the size the tray actually draws. Every candidate was extracted and looked
    // at side by side at 80, 48, 32, 24 and 16 before this was chosen
    // (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-18) -- joy.cpl's pad, which this replaces, is
    // prettier at 64px and collapses into a blob at 16.
    //
    // ⚠️ IT IS A WHITE SILHOUETTE, so on a LIGHT taskbar its body disappears
    // and only the dark detail is left. Chosen with a dark taskbar in front of
    // us; joy.cpl's coloured pad is the theme-safe one and is the first fallback
    // below, so switching back is one line.
    // ⓘ osk.exe stays as the last resort: it was the icon until 2026-09-17, its
    // icon is a keyboard, and it beats a blank application square.
    // ⛔ Index 108 is a POSITION in the file, which is what ExtractIcon takes.
