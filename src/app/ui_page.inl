// ⭐ WHY THE AGENT SERVES IT. Someone given only ctm-usbip.exe has no tools
// folder, so a page loaded from a file path does not exist for them. Serving it
// from the binary means the exe is the whole product.
//
// Three things fall out of it that were awkward before:
//   - the page cannot go stale against the agent, because the agent serves it
//   - same-origin, so no CORS header is sent at all (rest.inl says why)
//   - a phone on the LAN reaches it by browsing to the address, with no file
//     to copy onto the device
//
// ⚠️ AND ONE THING IS LOST. A file:// page opens whether or not the agent is
// running, so its "can't reach the listener" screen could greet you on a dead
// agent. Served over HTTP there is nothing to load, and you get the browser's
// own error page instead. That screen now only appears when the agent dies
// AFTER the page is open.

// gets that page instead of the built-in one. Deliberate -- it is the same rule
// that makes development work -- but it is a surprise worth knowing about, so

// ⭐⭐ THE SETTINGS WINDOW'S ICON (rhoquinn8217, 2026-10-01: *"update the

//
// ⛔ THE WINDOW IS A BROWSER'S, SO THE EXE'S ICON NEVER REACHED IT. open_ui
// starts Chrome or Edge with --app=, and a browser draws such a window's
// title-bar and taskbar icon from the page's FAVICON. The listener answered
// /favicon.ico with a 404, so the window wore the browser's default.
//
// ➡️ The .ico is linked into the exe a second time as raw bytes (RCDATA 101 in
// app/ctm-usbip.rc) and handed back here. ONE FILE ON DISK feeds the exe, the
// tray and this, so the three can never show three different bridges.
//
// ⚠️ THIS REACHES THE TITLE BAR ONLY AS FAR AS A FAVICON CAN. A browser keeps
// a favicon at favicon sizes and stretches it for anything bigger, so the
// window's TASKBAR button came out blurred from this alone. That one is
// handled in window_icon.inl, which gives the window its icons directly.
//
// ⓘ no-cache, not no-store: the browser may keep it but has to ask whether it
// is still current, so a rebuilt icon shows up without anyone clearing a cache.
