// first. rest_config.inl DECLARES these, this file DEFINES them, and this file
// is included after agent.inl -- the same split, for the same reason, as
// collect_bridge_session_snapshots().
//
// ⭐ The alternative was writing them inside agent.inl. "The data lives there"
// is not a reason for our code to live in an upstream file; that is how a fork
// accumulates edits it can no longer separate.
