// Adaptive trigger effects: giving a threshold somewhere the finger can find.
//
// ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. A trigger rebound to a mouse button fires at a position
// the finger cannot feel, so the only way to know where the click is, is to
// pull until something happens. The DualSense can put a physical resistance
// break at a chosen point in the travel. Put that break ON the click point and
// the trigger tells the finger where it is, the way a camera shutter's half
// press does.
//
// ⓘ WHERE THE LAYOUT COMES FROM, and how much of it is ours. The block
// positions are this project's own, from the 2026-08-24 on-wire capture in
// trigger_watch.inl. The PARAMETER packing below is published community
// knowledge, and it was checked against that same capture before anything here
// was written:
//
//     shotgun      25 04 01 07   ->  zones 0x0104 = bits 2 and 8, strength 7
//     machine gun  25 0c 00 ..   ->  zones 0x000c = bits 2 and 3
//
// ⭐ Both decode as sensible weapons under this packing and as nothing at all
// under any other reading, which is what makes it believed rather than
// assumed: a shotgun resists across most of the pull, a machine gun gives one
// short bump. NO CODE WAS COPIED -- the encoders below are written from the
// byte layout, the same posture ds5_apply_settings.inl takes toward the same
// project's field positions.
//
// ⛔ FEEDBACK MODE IS NOT CROSS-CHECKED. Only weapon mode appears in a capture
// we took. The feedback encoder is written from the published layout alone, so
// it is the one to distrust if something feels wrong.
//
// ---- THE WHOLE MODE SET, read up 2026-09-10 so the next person need not -----
//
// Eleven bytes per trigger, always. Byte 0 is the mode, the rest are its
// parameters, and the pull is addressed as ten ZONES rather than as the 0-255
// the input report gives back.
//

// ⭐ ONLY 0x21 AND 0x25 ARE USED HERE, and between them they cover everything

//
// ⭐⭐ WHAT EACH MODE IS ACTUALLY FOR, looked up 2026-09-10 after measuring
// them. Every finding below was measured FIRST and the reading agreed, which is
// why it is worth trusting in both directions:
//
//   weapon (0x25)  a GUN TRIGGER BREAK. Easy until a point, then it gives way.
//                  ⭐ The only mode modelling a discrete firing moment, and the
//                  only one that reports 0 / 1 / 2 -- before, during, past.
//                  ➡️ So it is the only shape a PRESS can be hung on.
//   feedback(0x21) RESISTANCE, not an event: drawing something heavy, grinding
//                  through mud, a stiff mechanism. Reports 0 before and 1 while
//                  engaged, and never 2, because there is nothing to come
//                  through. ⓘ Our wall and notch are both this mode.
//   bow    (0x22)  DRAWING A BOWSTRING, not firing: resistance plus a snap-back
//                  that returns the trigger. ⛔ Unofficial, and documented as
//                  probably not setting the status at all -- which is exactly
//                  what we measured, 0 from top to bottom on every pull.
//                  ⚠️ Also documented as liable to be REMOVED by a future
//                  controller firmware. Do not build anything on it.
//
// ⓘ That is why a click is the only shape whose press lands where the finger
// feels it. It is the only one Sony built to have a moment.
//
// ⚠️ WHERE WE KNOWINGLY DIVERGE FROM THE PUBLISHED FACTORIES:
//   1. **Strength.** They take 1-8 and send one less, so their 1 stores 0. We
//      take 1-7 and send it verbatim. Same maximum, and no value in the range
//      stores a zero -- which on this hardware is an effect that can neither be
//      felt nor used to clear the last one. That cost a morning; see below.
//   2. **Weapon's deep end.** They cap the start at zone 7 and the stop at 8.
//      We allow 8 and 9, because rhoquinn8217 asked for a deeper click and it
//      was then confirmed on hardware at both 30% and 90% (2026-09-10).
//
// ⛔⛔ THE BOW, AND WHY IT PROBABLY FAILED ON OUR SIDE (2026-09-10).
// It was really sent -- `22 80 01 1f` and `22 80 01 3f` are in the log, zones 7
// and 8, from a config that was genuinely linked. On the pad it gave resistance
// but never returned the trigger, and rhoquinn8217 reported the break getting
// HARDER as the snap force went up.
// ⭐ That last part is the clue, and it points at OUR ENCODING rather than at
// the mode. We packed two three-bit forces into byte 3, resistance low and snap
// high, on the strength of one written description. If the pad instead reads
// that byte as ONE number, then 0x1f is 31 and 0x3f is 63 where the other modes
// take 0 to 7 -- so raising the snap force would raise the resistance, which is
// exactly what was felt.
// ➡️ **The cheap retry is to put the snap force in byte 4 instead** and leave
// byte 3 as a plain strength. If the break then stops getting harder, the
// packing was the fault and the mode is fine. Do that before concluding the
// mode does nothing.
//
// ⭐⭐⭐ THE CONTROLLER REPORTS WHEN THE TRIGGER CROSSES A BREAK, and the byte
// is CONFIRMED on our own hardware (2026-09-10, ten pulls, a probe over the
// whole input report):
//
//     byte 42, HIGH NYBBLE  ->  the RIGHT trigger's adaptive status
//     byte 43, HIGH NYBBLE  ->  the LEFT trigger's, same encoding
//        0   short of the effect
//        1   crossed it
//        2   at the bottom of the travel
//
// ⓘ Measured with a weapon break at 80%: it went 08 -> 18 as the break gave
// way, 18 -> 28 at full travel, and straight back to 0 on the way out. On five
// pulls that stopped SHORT of the break it never left 0, which is what makes it
// the break rather than the travel -- travel we already have in byte 6.
// ⛔ THE LOW NYBBLE IS A COUNTER, not the stop zone. It increments on its own
// with the trigger at rest. Mask it off; do not read it.
// ⭐ BOTH ARE CONFIRMED, each by its own run. With an effect on the LEFT
// trigger only, byte 43 walked 08 -> 18 -> 29 and back while byte 42 never
// moved at all -- which is what makes them a pair rather than an assumption.
// ⓘ Byte 9's L2 bit moved in that run too, exactly as it should, which is the
// cross-check that the capture was of the trigger being pulled and not of
// something else happening at the same time.
//
// ➡️ WHAT IT IS FOR. A press can fire where the finger FEELS the break, rather
// than at a percent someone keeps in step with it by hand. Those two numbers
// drifted apart three times in one evening and each time it cost a round of
// testing. Asking the controller makes them the same event. See T-168.

//
// ⭐ SO THE WALL IS FLAT AND ONLY THE DETENT MOVES. The effort is the same

// the pad. Returns the claim bits whose blocks it replaced, 0 for none.
//
// ⛔ WHY IT IS NEEDED. The config's effect is SENT once, when a config links,
// and the pad keeps the last effect it was given. A game that speaks DualSense
// sends its own trigger blocks with its own claim bits, and those simply
// replaced ours: *"When Stellar Blade starts, the adaptive trigger feelings go
// away."* Rumble, both volumes and audio routing were already defended in every
// host report; the triggers were only observed.
//
// ⛔⛔ AND IT TOOK THE TRIGGER REMAP WITH IT, which is the part that hurt. A
// trigger set to click presses when the pad reports it is past the break. With
// the game's effect in place of ours -- or the game's "off" -- that report never
// comes, so the remap looked disabled while every other remap still worked.
//
// ➡️ THE SAME RULE RUMBLE FOLLOWS: only touch what the host is claiming. A
// report that does not claim a trigger leaves the pad holding ours already, and
// is left alone. A config that sets no effect owns nothing, and the game's
// effects stand -- so this changes nothing for a config that never asked.
