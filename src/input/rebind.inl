    // ⛔ When it consumes the input, the game must see NOTHING -- so the report
    // is blanked rather than merely left alone. A keyboard on screen that lets
    // stray presses through to what is behind it is worse than no keyboard.
    // ⛔ BOTH OF THESE READ, AND WRITE, THE REPORT -- and neither is handed the
    // descriptor, so the layout is resolved here, at the one place that has both
    // the descriptor and the calls, and handed to them.

    // ⓘ They used to be DualSense-only behind a guard: overlay_window.inl kept
    // its own copy of the DualSense bit table and blanked DualSense positions,
    // which on an Xbox GIP report land on the header, the sequence counter and
    // the length byte. ✅ Both read and write through the pad's layout now
    // (2026-09-15), so a DS4 or an Xbox pad types on the keyboard and moves
    // either window, and a pad with no layout is still left alone.
