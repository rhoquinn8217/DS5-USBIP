// Gyro-to-mouse for any pad whose layout names a motion sensor: DualSense,
// DualSense Edge and DualShock 4.
//
// ⭐ OFFSETS COME FROM THE PAD'S LAYOUT (input/button_layout.inl), not from the
// DualSense numbers below, which are kept as the record of where they came from.
// A DS4 carries the same sensor three bytes earlier -- gyro at [13] [15] [17],
// accelerometer at [19] [21] [23] -- and the touchpad and the buttons a gate
// reads sit elsewhere too.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. A DS5 input report carries the gyroscope and accelerometer.
// This turns the gyro's angular velocity into relative mouse movement, so a
// TV -- which has no mouse -- gains one driven by tilting the controller. The
// motion maths (calibration, drift removal, player-space) is Jibb Smart's
// GamepadMotionHelpers (MIT), the same method Steam Input is built on; we only
// read the bytes, gate, scale, and carry the sub-pixel remainder.
//
// WHERE IT SITS. device.inl calls ctm_gyro_mouse::on_ds5_input() once per
// mapped DS5 input report, just before enqueue_input_report(). It never
// modifies the report -- the controller passes through untouched, exactly as
// today -- it only pushes a mouse delta into a queue. A separate synthetic
// mouse device (see ds5_input_overrides / the mouse profile) drains that queue.
//
// WHAT IS OURS vs BORROWED. The byte offsets, the gate logic, and the config
// keys are ours, ported from the on-hardware DS5Dongle reference (which paid
// for the byte-17-not-19 yaw correction). The float maths is the library's.
//
// UNITS. The DualSense reports gyro at 1024 raw units per degree/second and
// accel at 8192 raw units per g. The library wants degrees/second and g.
//
// OFFSETS ARE OURS (report id at index 0). The DS5Dongle reference omits the
// report id, so every one of its offsets is ours - 1. Cross-checked against
// the mapped report this function receives (id 0x01 at [0]).
//   gyro  pitch int16 LE at [16], yaw at [18], roll at [20]
//   accel x int16 LE at [22], y at [24], z at [26]
//   L2 analog [5], R2 analog [6]; buttons byte [9] (L1 bit0, R1 bit1)
//   touchpad finger-1-down = !(byte[33] & 0x80)
// ⓘ Those are the DUALSENSE'S. Every pad's own now lives in its layout
// (input/button_layout.inl, MotionSpots and friends), and this file reads
// through that: a DS4's gyro sits at [13] [15] [17] and its first finger at
// [35], because [33] on a DS4 is the touch-packet count.
//
// GATE VALUES (config, per §6 of the design doc). Naming the gate turns the
// feature on; blank/absent = off. always | L2 | R2 | L1 | R1 | touchpad |

// ⭐⭐ A GATE IS TWO QUESTIONS, NOT ONE (T-241, 2026-09-20).
//
// ⛔ It used to be ONE choice list that mixed them: `"", always, L2, R2, L1,
// R1, R3, touchpad, !touchpad, touchpad_click, PS`. So "off" and "always" hid
// among the buttons, and the button list was hand-written -- T-235 had to add
// R3 to the enum, the parser, gate_open() and the schema before a preset could
// name it. Every button anyone wanted next cost the same four edits.
//
// rhoquinn8217 settled the shape: *"There's only two types. Always on until
// hold a button. Or on only when you hold a button. The other setting is what
// button you want to press which could be any button on a controller including
// triggers, touchpad touchpad press."*

    Off,         // no type chosen
    WhileHeld,   // the gyro moves only while the button is held
    UntilHeld,   // the gyro moves, and holding the button stops it
};

// ⚠️ **OFF IS THE ABSENCE OF A TYPE, NOT A THIRD TYPE.** The gate is the only
// on/off gyro-to-mouse has -- there is no separate enable, and the caller below
// returns early on Off -- so a blank type has to keep meaning off, exactly as a
// blank `gyro_to_mouse_gate` always has. A third entry would be a second way to
// say the same thing, and the two would drift.

// The button a gate watches: any of the 17 standard indices, plus two of the
// gate's own. ⛔ The touchpad is NOT in the button table -- a finger and a

// draft of this had only the second, which cannot say "any finger".
