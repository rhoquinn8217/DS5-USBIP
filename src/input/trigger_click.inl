// The trigger as a bound button, with the cursor held still for the whole press.
//
// ⭐⭐ THE GESTURE (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-10), once the adaptive trigger effect
// gave the click point somewhere a finger could find it:
//
//   R2 at rest                    the gyro moves the cursor
//   starting to pull              the cursor FREEZES
//   past the click point          the binding goes DOWN
//   let back up, not to rest      the binding goes UP, the cursor stays frozen
//   fully released                the cursor comes back
//   held past the window          the cursor comes back with the binding DOWN
//
// ⭐ ONE RULE MAKES ALL THREE OUTCOMES. The cursor is frozen for exactly as long
// as the finger is committed to pressing, and only a FULL release hands it back:
//
//   1. a single click   -- release straight away, and the cursor returns.
//   2. a double click   -- lift and press again without going home, and the
//                          cursor stays still across BOTH presses.
//   3. a drag           -- keep holding, and past the window the cursor returns
//                          while the binding stays down until the trigger goes
//                          home.
//
// ⛔ WHY THE FREEZE COVERS THE WHOLE GESTURE rather than each press. A double
// click needs both presses to land on the same pixel. Thawing between them lets
// the gyro move the cursor in the gap, which is precisely what stops a double
// click working on a pointer you aim with your hands.
//
// ⭐ THE WINDOW IS ONE NUMBER, NOT TWO. "Long enough that you meant to hold it"
// and "too long to still be a double click" are the same judgement, so the drag
// delay IS the double-click window. Two settings could disagree; this cannot.
//
// ⭐⭐ AND IT IS A BINDING, NOT A SWITCH (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-10): *"it
// shouldn't be a true/false setting. You should be able to remap this like the
// face buttons."* Quite right -- a trigger hardwired to the left mouse button
// is the only button on the pad that could not be pointed somewhere else. It
// takes the same names as `rebind_*` and resolves them the same way.
//
// ⓘ Reads the report and never modifies it. If a game should not also see the
// trigger, that is `mouse_exclusive.inl`'s job, not this file's.
//
// ⚠️ Binding the SAME trigger with `rebind_6`/`rebind_7` as well would fire
// twice, once here and once through the rebinder. A config that uses this
// should leave those blank.
