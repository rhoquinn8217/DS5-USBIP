// Stick-to-mouse: an analog stick drives the synthetic mouse.
//
// ⭐ THE THING THAT MAKES A STICK DIFFERENT from gyro and the touchpad: a stick
// reports a HELD POSITION, not a movement. Gyro says "you turned this much
// since last time" and the touchpad says "the finger moved this far"; a stick
// says "I am pushed this far right", every report, until you let go. So the
// movement it produces is speed x TIME, and the elapsed time between reports
// has to be measured. Multiplying deflection by a constant per report would
// tie cursor speed to the report rate -- the exact bug that made gyro need
// 33x its calibrated value when the mouse endpoint was polling too slowly.
//
// ⭐ READ-ONLY, like the gyro and touch hooks: the report is never modified, so
// a game still sees the stick exactly as before and this cannot regress
// anything. ⭐ ABSENT = OFF, as everywhere else.
//
// Standards this follows (surveyed 2026-08-31, AntiMicroX and Steam Input):
//   - a DEADZONE with rescaling, so movement starts from zero at the edge of
//     the deadzone instead of jumping to a step
//   - a RESPONSE CURVE: linear, quadratic or cubic, where the higher powers
//     slow the low end for precision and accelerate toward full deflection
//   - RADIAL deadzone and magnitude, not per-axis -- a per-axis deadzone makes
//     diagonals behave differently from straight pushes, which reads as the
//     stick being "sticky" near the axes
//   - acceleration off by default, because predictability beats speed here
//
// ⭐⭐ EVERY CONTROLLER WITH A LAYOUT, not only a DualSense (rhoquinn8217,
// 2026-09-15: "This pre-set should be available to all controllers actually").
// A stick is the one pointer every pad has. The pad's layout says where its
// sticks are and in what form: a byte centred at 0x80 on a DualSense or DS4, a
// signed 16-bit value centred at 0 on an Xbox pad -- ⚠️ whose map inverts Y, so
// up reads POSITIVE there. ctm_rebind::stick_axis() hands every pad back with
// left and up negative, which is what everything below was written against.
// ⓘ A generic HID pad has no layout, so it is still left alone.
//
// ⓘ Relies on its includer (main.cpp) for device_config_*, device_input_pad_for,
// device_settings_section, ctm_rebind_config_mode_effective, the gyro mailbox
// and its gate parser, and ctm_gyro_mouse_ensure_mouse_started.
