// key, and something has to BE a keyboard for that key to come from. Windows
// binds this to its stock HID keyboard driver exactly as it would a real one.
//
// ⛔ WHY NOT SendInput. That is synthetic injection and Windows flags it as
// such; games using raw input can see the flag, and anti-cheat often blocks it.
// It would fail in exactly the games people care about, and fail invisibly. A
// virtual USB keyboard is indistinguishable from hardware -- which is this
