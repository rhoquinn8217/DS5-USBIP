// is bridged its reports go to BOTH places at once: to the TV's SDL, which
// watches for the chord, and over USB/IP to Windows. So rolling through the
// chord hands Select and Start to the host, and Steam opens its on-screen
// keyboard and an app switcher behind the overlay -- every time.

// the chord's and are cleared from the report before Windows sees it. Nobody
// holds LB and RB together and then reaches for Start in a game.

// bumpers are down and the host has already had it.
//
// ⚠️ XBOX ONLY, on purpose (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-18: "only on xbox controller
// it seems"). The DualSense and the DS4 reach the TV by hidraw and ARE grabbed,
// so their reports do not go both ways -- and no one has seen this on them. To
