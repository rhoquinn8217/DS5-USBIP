// Synthetic mouse device: creation, export, attach, and the pump that turns
// mailbox deltas into HID mouse reports.
//
// LIFECYCLE DECISION (design doc §20). The mouse is created ONCE when the first
// DS5 session with a mouse gate becomes ready, and lives for the process. It is
// deliberately NOT created-per-session and NOT "appears on movement": config is
// read live, so a device that only existed when a gate was set at session start
// could never be turned on mid-session -- you cannot send movement to a device
// that does not exist. Always-present means the gate only decides whether the
// pump emits, never whether the device exists. Untidy (a mouse shows in Device
// Manager even with gyro off) but it is the only shape that preserves live
// tuning, which is the whole point.
//
// HOW IT SERVES REPORTS. CtmUsbipServer::handle_interrupt_in drains the
// device's own pendingInputReports_ queue and needs no backend -- so a device
// with nothing behind it works as-is. The pump thread below calls
// inject_synthetic_input() whenever the mailbox has movement, and the server's
// interrupt-IN worker delivers it to Windows. When idle it enqueues nothing, so
// the poll simply blocks -- correct for a mouse (no movement = no reports).
