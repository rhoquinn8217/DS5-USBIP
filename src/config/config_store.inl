// Per-controller config files.
//
// WHAT THIS ADDS. Settings are keyed by device TYPE today -- every DualSense
// reads [ds5]. Two controllers therefore cannot be tuned separately, which
// matters most for gyro sensitivity: a personal setting that is felt rather
// than reasoned about.
//
// A config file in configs/ can be LINKED to a specific bridged controller.
// Linked devices read that file; everything else keeps reading the shared
// section exactly as before, so a single-controller user never meets any of
// this.
//
// ⭐ THE DECISION THAT KEPT THIS SMALL. Loading a config file puts its settings
// in a section of their own, beside the shared ones:
//
//     configs/couch.txt   [settings] speaker_volume = 65
//         becomes         g_device_config["cfg:couch"]["speaker_volume"]
//
// So "link a device to a config" is just "look up a different section name",
// and device_config_str/int/bool are UNCHANGED and unaware any of this exists.
//
// ⭐⭐ A CONFIG IS NOT TIED TO A CONTROLLER TYPE (rhoquinn8217, 2026-09-12).
// The section used to carry the kind -- "cfg:couch/ds5" -- so a DualSense
// config could not go on an Xbox pad, and a pad with no kind of its own could
// have no config at all. Nothing a config stores needed it: buttons are W3C
// positions, trigger points are percents, times are milliseconds, and every
// feature checks the pad before it acts. So every controller linked to "couch"
// reads the one section, and uses whatever of it that controller can.
//
// ⓘ The shared ctm-device-config.txt keeps its [ds5] and [xbox] sections. Those
// are hardware defaults for a controller with no config linked, and different
// hardware genuinely wants different defaults.
//
// FILE FORMAT
//     [config]
//     auto_link = aabbccddeeff         ; serials linked automatically at bridge
//
//     [settings]
//     speaker_volume = 65
//
// ⓘ A file written before 2026-09-12 says `kind = ds5` and keeps its settings
// in a [ds5] block. It still loads, into the same section: with no [settings]
// block, the block named by its kind IS its settings. Loading never rewrites
// it, and a write goes into the block it already has.
//
// !! ABSENT IS NOT DEFAULTED. A key a file does not mention is left alone,
// !! exactly as with no config at all. That is the existing rule and nothing
