// The presets a new config can start from.
//
// ⭐ HELD IN CODE, NOT ON DISK. A preset file could be edited, deleted, or left
// out of a release -- build.ps1 and release.ps1 both carry hardcoded copy
// lists, and forgetting a new file there has bitten this project before. In
// code it cannot break, it survives a fresh install, and a config made from one
// is an ORDINARY file: fully editable, and one press from being made again if
// it gets wrecked. Nothing here is read-only.
//
// ⭐ THESE ARE DESKTOP CONFIGS, NOT GAME CONFIGS (rhoquinn8217, 2026-08-31).
// The workflow is: chord out of the game, switch a controller to one of these,
// drive Windows, switch back. So they bind AGGRESSIVELY -- taking the right
// stick or the d-pad costs nothing, because nothing is being played while one
// is linked.
//
// ⚠️ NO TUNING NUMBERS. No speeds, curves or sensitivities: every key here is
// one that turns something ON, and the rest is left to the built-in defaults,
// which are the work that has already been done for the common case. A number
// written here would be a guess competing with a measured default.
//
// ⓘ The shared bindings are the Steam Deck's desktop layout, with one move:
// Valve puts Show Keyboard on X (Square's position) and Space on Y
// (Triangle's). rhoquinn8217 asked for the keyboard on Square, which is where
// Valve has it, so the two agree.
//
// ⚠️ AND A KNOWN LIMIT, worth reading before wondering why: Square opens
// Steam's keyboard, but a REBOUND button is stripped from the report before
// Steam sees it -- so with one of these linked, the keyboard opened and the pad
// could not drive it. Windows' own keyboard does not register our controller at
// all.
//
// ⭐ SUPERSEDED 2026-09-02: Square now opens OUR on-screen keyboard, which
// reads the pad directly and has none of these problems. ⛔ No ticket id here:
// this is a public repo.
