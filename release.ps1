# correctly, and a page that can drift from the API it talks to is a bug waiting
# to happen. Profiles and maps are NOT, and that is deliberate: this project's
# own rule is that adding a device is data, never a recompile. Baking them into
# the binary would make adding a controller a build.
#
# ⛔ Found the hard way on 2026-08-23: an exe copied on its own bridged nothing,
# failing with "Could not open descriptor profile". Embedding the page had made
# it look like one file was enough.

DS5-USBIP $Version
==================

Start it: double-click ctm-usbip.exe

It runs in the background. No window opens for it: look for the DS5-USBIP icon
in the tray, by the clock. Click it for Controller Configs, where each
controller's settings are made, or for the on-screen keyboard, and choose Quit
there to close it. Double-click the exe again while it is running and
Controller Configs comes to the front.

Want it on your desktop? Double-click create-desktop-shortcut.bat once.
It builds the shortcut from wherever this folder currently is, so MOVE THE
FOLDER FIRST and then run it -- a Windows shortcut stores the full path and
cannot follow the folder afterwards. Running it again replaces the old one.

To watch it instead, with its log on screen, type this at a command prompt
in this folder. The prompt comes straight back and the listener's lines follow
in the same window. Ctrl+C in that window ends it, and so does closing the
window or choosing Quit from the tray icon:

    ctm-usbip.exe agent --ui --verbose

IMPORTANT: FIRST, install usbip-win2 0.9.77 from
https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2/releases -- a separate project whose
signed driver lets Windows attach the controller. Without it this listener
starts normally and bridges nothing.

Keep this folder together, somewhere writable -- Desktop or Documents, not
Program Files. The exe finds profiles and maps beside itself, and creates its
config and logs here as you use it, wherever it is started from. If the
profiles folder is missing it says so and does not start.

Controller Configs opens in a browser window, but the page is built into the
exe and served by it, so there is no file to place and it cannot fall out of
step with the version you are running.

What is in here, and what each part is for:

    ctm-usbip.exe             the listener: double-click it
    create-desktop-shortcut.bat   puts a shortcut to it on your desktop
    *.dll                     ffmpeg, for audio
    profiles\descriptors\     what each controller looks like over USB
    maps\                     how its reports translate

Profiles and maps are DATA, on purpose. Adding a controller means adding a
file here, not rebuilding -- so keep the folders beside the exe. Without them
the listener says the profiles folder is missing and does not start.

These are created next to the exe as you use it:

    configs\                  each controller's settings, made in Controller Configs
    device.log                what it did, for when something goes wrong
    window-state.txt          where you left Controller Configs, and its size
    keyboard-state.txt        where you left the on-screen keyboard, and its size

ctm-device-config.txt, if it is there, holds settings shared by every
controller with no config of its own. Nothing creates it: it is written by hand.
