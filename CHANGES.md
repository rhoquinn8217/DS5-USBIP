| 2026-07-29 | Added PCM amplitude logging to the wired ISO audio path | `e3afa55`, `841d9a2`, `cbae4b4` |
| 2026-07-30 | Check the keepalive enable result instead of discarding it | `61302f7` |
| 2026-07-30 | Log bridge session transitions; flush log output so teardown lines are not lost | `dbec96f`, `87d1427` |
| 2026-08-01 | Windows-side device configuration. A text config file drives echo cancellation, audio routing, volumes and gains; edits apply live | `570ba61`, `20d14cb`, `fcc55ba`, `7cb8f1f`, `706b88c`, `382d18f`, `78dbdd1`, `2e6b42f`, `70c17dd`, `a7efc78`, `b496d08`, `a42dbe4`, `4fdf97f` |
| 2026-08-02 | Controller microphone audio, host side. Completions release after the audio they carry, ending a busy loop of ~28,000 requests a second | `76493f2`, `ec3c9de`, `99030fa`, `d7553ef` |
| 2026-08-04 | Microphone buffers are per session, not per process. One shared buffer let a second controller drain the first one's audio | `310df17`, `4a1d11e` |
| 2026-08-05 | Mute the controller's microphone from the host, so nothing else can leave it streaming. The bit layout is asserted in tests | `f85de1a` |
| 2026-08-05 | Accept the DualSense Edge. Its own captured USB descriptor makes Windows identify it as an Edge, which its extra controls need | `8fbb26d`, `9d8e3d7` |
| 2026-08-11 | Hold the audio stream open briefly after bridging. The controller's audio sleeps when idle, and waking it swallowed the start of a sound | `4edd287`, `e9eceea`, `0d0c907` |
| 2026-08-12 | A settings panel for the DualSense Edge, so its configuration can be edited without hand-writing the file | `e998d29` |
| 2026-08-12 | Drop the audio hold. The TV signals its own controllers now, so the host need not keep the stream awake for it | `f36f272` |
| 2026-08-13 | Drop microphone reports before anything reads them as pad state. Audio arrives in the button report, one flag apart, and reads as presses | `9bdbf81` |
| 2026-08-16 | The host owns the controller's Bluetooth audio buffer. `audio_latency_ms` reaches a live session in a second or two, with no reconnect | `c3e2496`, `1b12d9e` |
| 2026-08-19 | Stop preloading feature reports a Bluetooth DualSense never answers. They shared the link with the TV's tone and took the pad offline | `366b0de`, `08dabcd` |
| 2026-08-20 | Optional HTTP/JSON control API (`--rest <port>`): status, sessions, bridge start/stop, restart. Loopback-only unless `--rest-lan` | `4875cb3` |
| 2026-08-21 | Per-controller configuration. A controller links to its own config file, can claim a serial so it re-attaches at bridge time, updates live | `b08a90f`, `8b6e26a`, `3f63e49`, `e550c01`, `bf325cc`, `5abf076`, `71b6360`, `7132194`, `16c5054` |
| 2026-08-21 | Gyro-to-mouse. Motion drives a synthetic USB mouse using the pad's own calibration, so a sensitivity number means the same on every pad | `8556242`, `b02ea17`, `2cb9c26`, `395b8b3`, `a640c2e`, `25e9c76` |
| 2026-08-23 | The agent serves its own settings page (`--ui`), embedded in the executable and usable entirely from a controller | `ccb1f56`, `b7bf340`, `78c6095`, `c162412`, `21b5999`, `9b0d4ea`, `3a85ee7`, `ff5b164`, `022f131`, `46109c7`, `8ce9227`, `13fcd7a`, `a036db3`, `e0a5719`, `11f3301` |
| 2026-08-24 | A release script and launcher: one folder with a README. Upstream's release FFmpeg replaces the debug binaries, and the build fetches vcpkg | `27eea1e`, `ab8cb60`, `0b2202a`, `23d7ad4` |
| 2026-08-26 | One log format, tagged by layer and quiet by default, with repeated lines collapsed rather than printed hundreds of times | `fdc8325`, `f82d303` |
| 2026-08-28 | Button rebinding. A button sends a keyboard key or mouse action through synthetic USB devices, and the game stops seeing the button | `e1ae04d`, `693f00c`, `69635b6` |
| 2026-08-28 | Config mode and the chord that opens it. Two fingers plus Options opens the settings window; the pad drives it and the game hears nothing | `f9c2d8e`, `76ab5e8`, `a72c741`, `fa9bfa1`, `ce2aa02`, `f9270a5` |
| 2026-08-31 | The touchpad drives the mouse: one finger the cursor, two fingers scroll, a tap clicks. Clicking the pad in grabs a drag, lifting drops it | `229314e`, `6bddf3e` |
| 2026-08-31 | A stick drives the mouse, and a stick scrolls. Travel is speed times elapsed time, so it does not change with the report rate | `25527ef`, `b3cd198` |
| 2026-08-31 | An on-screen keyboard on a button. `OSKeyboard` toggles Steam's keyboard or Windows' `osk.exe`; only Steam's takes a controller | `470f1ea` |
| 2026-08-31 | Presets on New: gyro-to-mouse, stick-to-mouse, touchpad-mouse, L2-gyro-mouse-aiming. Ordinary configs, named after the preset | `6bddf3e`, `e44f113` |
| 2026-08-31 | One settings section at a time, and Safe Edit Mode names what the lock costs: basic controls only, or your inputs mirror in the game | `25527ef`, `988562f`, `b989322`, `35424b7` |
| 2026-08-31 | Tests stopped deleting the agent's configs. They ran where the agent reads and removed the user's files; they use a scratch dir now | `229314e` |
| 2026-09-08 | Options moves the settings window and R3 sizes it, the same gesture the on-screen keyboard uses. A tap places it, a hold steers it with the stick or the mouse | `764e06c`, `b8ffac7`, `01f247d`, `239000b`, `79c03b4` |
| 2026-09-09 | Three layouts for the settings window: SIMPLE, one controller and its config; QUICK, the same cut to a name and a selector for reaching mid-game; ADVANCED, the full page. Create goes straight to Quick, and the listener remembers the layout, size, place and controller across a close | `339ef21`, `6f83ccf`, `fc6982a`, `9097921`, `faa5760`, `36dae19`, `241e69a` |
| 2026-09-09 | One Options mover per controller: two bridged pads shared one, so a hold on either snapped the window on every report of the other. The stick that steers a window no longer also drives the mouse, and travel is speed times elapsed time, so it does not change with the report rate | `1526c97`, `1256eea`, `5f9e4db` |
| 2026-09-10 | The touchpad preset scrolls naturally, and its description says so | `f8ad9ac` |
| 2026-09-10 | Adaptive trigger effects: a resistance break, a wall, or a climb that lets go, placed anywhere in the pull | `bbfcd5f`, `9f9b847`, `6cbe348`, `eaf2e55`, `33ff84d` |
| 2026-09-10 | R2 as a mouse click: the cursor freezes for the whole gesture, so a double click lands twice on one pixel, and a held click becomes a drag | `890fab0`, `1db8342` |
| 2026-09-11 | A trigger is bound in one place. `rebind_6` and `rebind_7` say what it sends, as for any other button, and a per-side mode says what pulling it does to the cursor. Setting both no longer sends two presses per pull | `c948bad`, `7abdd1e`, `6e873e6`, `962e7fc`, `b285c83`, `9262f50`, `f0d70f6` |
| 2026-09-11 | The press lands on the break the finger feels. The controller is asked rather than a travel number guessed: byte 42 for the right trigger, byte 43 for the left, both confirmed on hardware. Two thresholds so a resting trigger cannot chatter | `aa00e2a`, `4950379`, `573d079`, `f8ab6eb`, `e935859`, `dac514b`, `8a9cd41`, `fd15276` |
| 2026-09-11 | Four trigger feels, each measured rather than assumed: a break, a wall, a wall with a detent, and a break that returns itself. A notch and a snap press on travel, because the hardware cannot name their moment. An effect of "off" now clears the trigger whenever it is asked for | `64efd09`, `86317a5`, `265418c`, `8f1a672`, `856e615`, `5325e54`, `458f4f6`, `7e7001e`, `ca47551`, `033758f` |
| 2026-09-11 | The gyro gate and the trigger's steady are separate settings, so one trigger can open the gate on a light hold and click at its break. The drag and double-click windows are per side, because which trigger wants them follows what it is bound to | `258c07b`, `fdbc0ca`, `ccfa2d0` |
| 2026-09-11 | Two ways a mouse button could be left held down, both closed: the rebinder went silent once it gave a trigger up, and the pump recorded a release as sent before checking there was a device to send it to | `012fef6` |
| 2026-09-11 | Settings page 2.64.48: trigger settings grouped and ordered, the compact config picker steps in place instead of opening a list taller than its window, preset previews drop tuning numbers and passthroughs, and the trigger log reports both sides | `dad60d1`, `f763fe1`, `e0b521d`, `91b2c38`, `b06d011`, `683b091`, `3daa7a3`, `3c33c4f`, `9d74ebd`, `012d986`, `9006b65` |
| 2026-09-12 | Check which pad it is before reading the pad. The mouse hooks, the rebinder and the gates read DualSense offsets on whatever arrived, so a DS4's timestamp read as a button; each path now asks the layout first | `5e270d1` |
| 2026-09-12 | A button layout per pad, resolved once per report, with an Xbox table read off its own map file. Config mode rests a pad at its own offsets, where DualSense positions had frozen an Xbox report instead of resting it | `96ecdcf`, `f60b096` |
| 2026-09-12 | A config is no longer tied to a controller type. Any config links to any controller, each setting checks the pad before it acts, and an existing DS5 config keeps working unchanged | `3800cff` |
| 2026-09-14 | A new bridge retires an older one only when the serial and the TV's node both match, so a second pad no longer displaces the first | `e99dcf5` |
| 2026-09-14 | A mouse, keyboard or other bridged part is never dropped for being idle. Only a pad has an idle timeout, because only a pad is expected to keep talking | `8177f0e` |
| 2026-09-15 | A cabled DualShock 4 is a controller in its own right: its own kind, map and button table, steering the mouse by gyro, touchpad and stick from its own layout, named as itself in the text and the presets | `c3e7852`, `a926df5`, `ef0c5a9`, `53bd775`, `d4c1d5b`, `dbbcd83` |
| 2026-09-15 | An Xbox trigger pulled past a threshold presses like a button. Its triggers carry no digital bit, so every binding on them had been silent | `192e2d1` |
| 2026-09-15 | Each pad keeps its own held mouse buttons and its own chord state, so a pad lying at rest no longer releases another pad's drag | `f955fd4`, `449003f` |
| 2026-09-15 | The left stick scrolls even when no stick is moving the cursor | `d709b51` |
| 2026-09-15 | A trigger whose steady switch is off fires its remap again | `15da386` |
| 2026-09-15 | A map's handshake outranks the pad's own input in the queue, and every bridged pad announces its own id rather than the captured one | `55b6a79`, `581efbe` |
| 2026-09-15 | Diagnostics: the first fifty served packets are written out, the queue cap says when it eats one, and the log says whether the host is collecting what we queue | `833029e`, `5bf617d` |
| 2026-09-16 | The microphone guard writes to a DualSense, not to every device whose report is the same shape | `1f84fec` |
| 2026-09-17 | The gyro's hold has one definition, shared with the trigger tests rather than copied | `5ce687a` |
| 2026-09-17 | `device.log` is capped at 20 MB with one older file kept, and the every-report lines move behind their own switch. An unattended run had written 227 MB | `757b51a`, `61b0ddd` |
| 2026-09-17 | DS5-USBIP has a name and a version of its own, 0.1.0, shown from one place: the command line, the file properties, the status endpoint and the page | `827556c` |
| 2026-09-17 | A device is named by its model, then its type, and "hid" only when nothing else is known | `f407995` |
| 2026-09-17 | A serial of ALL ZEROS is no identity. One refusal in `normalise_serial`, so a config file's claim is dropped as it is read, nothing auto-links to it, and adding such a claim is refused. All zeros, not leading zeros: a Switch Pro Controller's `000000000001` is a real per-unit serial | `49084cc` |
| 2026-09-18 | The pad's own charge, read off the report the listener already receives, and shown as a battery beside the controller's name in all three views and as a column in both device tables. Offsets measured on the pads, not taken from a header; a pad with no battery byte, or in a fault state, shows nothing at all rather than zero | `929760c`, `88bc398`, `4e17c9b`, `a69278f`, `01f8d67`, `2823912`, `73f298c` |
| 2026-09-18 | The settings page talks to the port it was SERVED from instead of a hardcoded 48055, so a listener on any other REST port no longer looks dead while answering | `98046e8` |
| 2026-09-18 | The tray icon is a controller rather than a keyboard, and a click opens a menu -- settings or the keyboard -- instead of opening the keyboard outright | `cfefe25`, `c211ae4` |
| 2026-09-18 | The TV's overlay chord is taken out of a bridged Xbox pad's report: while both bumpers are held, Select and Start are cleared before Windows is served them, so the chord opens the TV's overlay without Steam opening its keyboard behind it. The bumpers, the face buttons and the d-pad are untouched | `0063ce8` |
| 2026-09-19 | The parts of one device share one nickname. A dongle arrives as two or three separate bridges and each was named on its own, so one device answered to two words that exist only to be said out loud. Measured across three multi-part devices: every part reaches the listener with an identical product string, because the TV sends the USB device's iProduct and not the part's own name | `c799ad3` |
| 2026-09-19 | A rumble floor, so a faint cue stays faint rather than vanishing. A straight multiply at low gain leaves a motor below the amplitude that starts it turning. `rumble_floor` is a percentage, default 12, which is the floor DS4Windows settled on. A motor the game asked to stop, and a motor the person gained to zero, are both left silent | `ae13560` |
| 2026-09-19 | A game's own adaptive trigger effect no longer replaces the config's. The config's effect is sent once, when a config links, while a DualSense-aware game sends its own trigger blocks in every output report -- which took the trigger remaps with them, since a click remap fires on a break that was no longer there. Only a trigger the host is actually claiming is rewritten | `33bcede` |
| 2026-09-19 | A gear on the on-screen keyboard's tab, on all three faces, opening the config window. The keyboard swallows the pad while it is up, so the window was unreachable without knowing a chord. Each tab row must now span its face exactly, checked at compile time rather than noticed on a television | `3b6383c` |
| 2026-09-19 | An Unlink button wherever the config is shown, and Reset retired. Every view gets a button that sets the controller to no config: at the end of the row in the full view, left of the selector in the two compact ones, with the mark after its word. It asks nothing, because picking "(no config)" asks nothing either. The mark is U+1F6C7, a text-presentation glyph, so it takes the button's colour instead of being drawn as a red emoji. "Auto link no config" now means remove the auto link: the auto-link button used to be dead whenever no config was linked, which is exactly the state Unlink leaves behind, and with a claim standing it now offers to drop it. Reset and its column leave both device tables and its question goes with them | `b757c87`, `afe30dc`, `26d9545`, `03d3561`, `3f5c155` |
| 2026-09-20 | The Editor tab owns every config action and Overview owns none. Its New button was dead rather than narrow -- it returned on its second line whenever no controller matched -- and Archive moved there because it was the only action in Overview's table belonging to a config rather than a controller. The config picker now opens as far as the window allows, upward as well as down, out of flow so nothing below it is pushed: a select with a size grows downward IN FLOW, which is why row counts of 8 and then 5 were both compromises with a layout rather than a size. The row under the mouse highlights, a mouse can pick -- preventDefault on mousedown had been killing the selection before it happened -- and in Quick it grows sideways too, measured against the longest name rather than guessed. Archiving the config you are editing closes it and takes its section tabs with it | `7e275b6`, `2265873`, `f2efa9c`, `6471aa8`, `e7999a8`, `cd1213e`, `b06930a`, `b1a0e18`, `db60748`, `f2a6c9a` |
| 2026-09-20 | One Mode picker replaces the view buttons and locks the window to a layout, and a day of shaping it: reachable by pad, sized like the Close button beside it and paired with it in the bottom right, carrying the mode identifier itself in yellow capitals with a padlock so no legend names its mode any more. It always opens UPWARD, by pad and by mouse, because it sits in the footer and a native popup is not clipped by the window. New, Edit, Mode and Close read as one sideways chain and arriving at the selector row means the config picker. Circle in Simple goes TO the Close button rather than closing. A compact view opens at bottom centre, which is where reposition now starts from rather than stepping on from whichever place was nearest by x alone. Create resizes the window and R3 is given back to the gyro | `2730d5c`, `be236d8`, `532a2de`, `64a7129`, `28aa2b7`, `c5c0a97`, `113420d`, `0bad48f`, `c32d475`, `5dd1d94`, `281370c`, `d2ef3c6`, `f008327`, `d8ba7bb` |
| 2026-09-20 | The adaptive trigger settings are greyed on a pad that has none, with the reason on the row. Eight keys rather than the Triggers section: press_at, the two timings and steady_cursor_pull all work on a DS4, because a trigger is an analogue axis whatever the pad | `de1710b`, `d4ad04a` |
| 2026-09-20 | The preset set renamed into one shape and gained an R3-gated one, which meant adding R3 to the gyro gate -- four lines, because the button already had a spot in both tables. Both always-on gyro presets steady the cursor on either trigger, so a click lands where you were pointing. "Blank" is called "custom", a config made from it is named after the pad that asked -- ds5_config, ds4_config, xbox_config, pad_config -- and the list opens on the stick, the one preset every pad can use | `01c58bc`, `b393888`, `f2a6c9a` |
| 2026-09-20 | trigger_probe is hidden on the settings page. It is a diagnostic whose own help says to leave it off, and it sat in Triggers for everyone. Listed by name rather than renamed to a _debug key, which would have hidden it for free: the key is read in two places in the listener, and anyone with it set in a config file would have lost it silently | `006290a` |
| 2026-09-20 | A DS4 is still NOT offered the Audio section, after a day spent finding out why it cannot be. The three settings travel to the TV rather than being patched into a DualSense report, so they reach any pad and the section was opened up on that reasoning -- then neither volume moved anything on the pad, and the routing mode neither silenced a connected headset nor started the speaker. Arriving is not acting, so it is hidden again with the finding and an undo list against T-229 | `d68fc4d`, `006290a` |
| 2026-09-20 | Copy asks for a name before it makes one, the way Rename does: an expanding row opened on the name it would have chosen, editable, with Create and Cancel. Both Copy buttons, because one expanding and one firing instantly is two buttons with the same word behaving differently. ONE row serves both jobs -- a second would have been a dozen more places to keep the guard flag in step, since it gates the d-pad, the plain keys, Escape, Space and the config poll. And the row now closes on a tab change: it used to survive, still pointing at the config from the tab you left, so Save renamed something off screen while the ten-second config poll stayed suppressed | `6f5daa4` |
| 2026-09-20 | The gyro gate is TWO settings: `gyro_to_mouse_gate_type` says when -- off, on button release, on button hold -- and `gyro_to_mouse_gate_button` says which, from any of the 17 button indices plus six touchpad gestures. The one key before it mixed both questions, so "off" and "always" hid among the buttons and the button list was hand-written: T-235 paid four edits to add R3. The invert IS the type, so "always on" is the type with no button and `!touchpad` becomes "on button release" on the touchpad, which is what "move unless a finger is down" says. Two traps, both pinned by tests: reading the triggers through `is_pressed()` would have passed on an Xbox pad while making a DualSense's L2 a hair trigger, and a draft with four touchpad gestures had no plain "any finger" case, which is what the old `touchpad` value meant. The old key is hidden and still read, proven on three legacy files covering `always`, `L2` and the dead `trigger` alias. `Gate::TriggerHold`, unreachable, is gone | `1d6267e`, `0854cb2`, `5c24bfb`, `a92775f`, merge `f510a3d` |
| 2026-09-21 | The settings window comes back where it was left, in every mode. Two placers were fighting: the page's `sizeOnOpen` reaches `compactHome`, which does not only resize but MOVES the window to bottom centre, so a restored place was discarded milliseconds after it landed; and `fitWindowIfOversized` read a stale `window.outerWidth` -- `resizeTo` is asynchronous, a fact stated a few lines above it -- saw Chrome's remembered 2341x1009 instead of the size just set, and yanked the window to Advanced's geometry. Twice per open, measured. Advanced was the one mode unaffected, because it is the one `sizeOnOpen` skips, and that is what named the bug. The layout, size, place and controller now also survive a listener restart, in `window-state.txt` beside `configs/`. A false alarm is recorded with it: the fix was twice declared incomplete from a PowerShell probe that was DPI-unaware while the listener is `PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2`, so every coordinate it read came back divided by the 1.25 display scale. Three separate unexplained numbers were that one mistake | `833eb44`, `1587dfc`, `cfd5a84`, merge `9116c5a` |
| 2026-09-21 | The settings page's button legend follows the pad in your hand, not the pad the window is showing. It asks the LISTENER which device pressed last, because the browser structurally cannot answer: the rebinder clears a bound button out of the report before Windows sees it, so `navigator.getGamepads()` only ever shows the buttons a config has not claimed -- in practice L1 and R1 alone, which is exactly what was observed. A new `GET /api/v1/lastpress` returns the ordinal and kind, recorded at the top of `apply()` before anything clears a button, for ANY button rather than the ten the page navigates with, since a trigger pull is a press. The page polls it four times a second while its window is in front and not at all when it is behind, so the legend is right the moment you look at it; `/devices` at four seconds could never have done this. The browser scan stays as the answer for a pad plugged in but not bridged, whose buttons nothing clears. The legend also shows the marks on the buttons rather than their names: a compass for the d-pad in both sets, and the three-lines and two-rectangles marks in place of spelling out Menu and View | `c9df0a2`, `f3f2b2b`, `16fb5f4`, `13e80ac`, `867bccc`, `386f441`, merge `9116c5a` |
| 2026-09-21 | PARTIAL, and the ticket stays open. A touchpad tap is remappable: one finger, two fingers, and press-and-drag each take a mouse action instead of being hard-wired to left, right and drag. The ask was wider -- keyboard keys, controller buttons and the on-screen keyboard openers as well. Keyboard openers were reachable and were simply not done. Keyboard keys need a synthetic hold, because `set_state_for()` publishes a device's WHOLE held-key set and the rebinder republishes it every report, so an outside writer is overwritten within about 4ms and a tap holds nothing. Controller buttons need a `set_button()` that does not exist: the layout only offers `clear_button()` and the rebinder only ever removes buttons from a report | `d5ac645`, merge `9116c5a` |
| 2026-09-24 | Opening the settings window's mode selector no longer moves the footer about. The cause is the opposite of what it looks like: `pickerExpand` already sets `position:fixed`, so the box LEAVES the flow and the footer closes over the gap. Measured in Simple at 1238x498 -- `.cbarText` grew 767 to 993 to fill it, sliding the centred legend 113px right, and the extra width let `.cinfo` fit on one line, which shrank the bar 16px and dropped Close 8px. A measured spacer holds the collapsed footprint while the list is open; it is a `span`, so the pad's focus list (`.cbar > button, .cbar > select`) does not see it. The config selector shares the expand path and had the same fault | `63fcac2`, merge `b359238` |
| 2026-09-24 | The settings window can be dragged by any empty space, in Simple and Quick. The page cannot move its own window -- it is a plain `--app=` window, where `-webkit-app-region` does nothing -- so it reports one mousedown and the LISTENER drags, as it already does for the pad's position control. Three traps avoided: `place()` writes the state file, so the loop moves the window directly and remembers the place once at the end; `SM_SWAPBUTTON` decides which button to watch, because a swapped-button user's primary press arrives as `VK_RBUTTON`; and the mousedown is defaulted away so dragging across the legend does not select it. The notice strip counts as empty space too -- it is `position:fixed` at body level, so the first version exited before its `preventDefault()` and both selected the text and refused the drag | `80c998c`, `b6b2052`, merge `b359238` |
| 2026-09-24 | ⛔ The browser title bar STAYS on the settings window, and the reason is worth keeping. Clearing `WS_CAPTION` and `WS_THICKFRAME` on the `--app=` window works and Chrome does not re-assert it -- but the whole non-client area is **8px**, a resize border. A real title bar is ~31px. The caption is Chrome's own, painted INSIDE the client area, so no style bit reaches it. Removing it would mean an installed PWA with `window-controls-overlay`, which is where `-webkit-app-region: drag` becomes supported | spike only, no code |
| 2026-09-24 | The settings page's legend has THREE forms -- PlayStation, Xbox and keyboard -- chosen by what last pressed. The footer used to name the input device twice in one bar: the legend opened with `- controller -` or `keyboard -` while the destination line beside it said `controllers -> page`. Both prefixes are gone. ⭐ The mechanism is the thing that made it look impossible: a gated pad arrives AS KEYSTROKES, so nothing about what arrives separates it from typing -- but those keystrokes carry `CTM_GATE_MODS 0x07`, Ctrl+Alt+Shift, and a real keyboard's do not. The page already had two keydown handlers split on that guard and never said which was which. The keyboard table uses the same seven fields as the pad ones, so all three render through one string | `c1b7205`, `c1a49d0`, merge `61224dd` |
| 2026-09-24 | A keyboard can now drive the settings window fully. `Q` and `E` switch controller -- they existed only in `CONFIG_MODE_KEYS`, behind the three-modifier guard that tells a gated pad's keystroke from typing, so a bare `Q` reached nothing. `P` positions and `R` resizes, which a keyboard could not do at all: both were readable only from the pad's RAW report, so new `ui/position` and `ui/resize` routes call the same two functions the pad does (`snap_next`, `resize_next`) and cannot drift from it | `c1a49d0`, merge `61224dd` |
| 2026-09-24 | The virtual keyboard opens only where you type FREE TEXT -- a config's name, the agent URL, the bearer token -- and not over a setting's value box, which the pad already steps through with `GP_EDITING`. ⚠️ Two mistakes are recorded with it because each was a different shape: the page's flag was too generous (any typeable field), and the listener's refusal keyed on the GATE rather than on the settings window being in front -- so with no pad gated the refusal was skipped entirely and a keyboard opened over anything | `4a1aeea`, `d6c9d2a`, `e1e05b1`, merge `61224dd` |
| 2026-09-24 | ⛔ Landing on a tab no longer focuses a text field, which used to switch the page's keyboard off completely. `gpTab()` focused the first control on the pane and `#pane-overview`'s first control is the agent URL; a focused text field makes `typingInAField()` true, which stops arrows, Enter and every other key with no message. ⓘ Only reachable once a plain `Q` could drive `gpTab`. The text test is one shared function now, and `type === ''` counts -- `<input id="base">` has no type attribute at all | `a5688fc`, merge `61224dd` |
| 2026-09-30 | The touchpad cursor moves at once, and is PUT BACK when a touch turns out not to be a move. A late second finger and a slow tap both used to move the cursor. Holding every move for 150 ms to see what the touch was fixed that and made the pad feel unresponsive, so it was dropped the same day. Now the real cursor is read as a finger lands and placed back with `SetCursorPos`: a tap clicks where the finger landed (taps measured on a DualSense Edge rolled 23 to 84 units and took up to 390 ms, so the tap limits went from 15 units and 250 ms to 100 and 400); a second finger within 200 ms goes back to where the first landed, and the scroll happens there; a press to drag goes back to where the cursor was 100 ms before it, unless the finger travelled over 120 units in that time. One `[touch] end` line per touch in `device.log` carries the numbers the limits were read from. | `4ace5c1`, `89dcdc4`, `b44c421` |
| 2026-09-30 | A second finger coming down puts the cursor back to before the pad dragged the first one. For 30 to 75 ms before a DualSense Edge reports a second finger it moves the first finger's reported position toward it, sometimes across the whole pad, and can hand the first finger's touch id to the new one. A regular DualSense barely does: its largest put-back in one evening was 55 px against the Edge's 1,665 px. Nothing in a report says a finger is on its way, so the cursor goes back when it lands: to where it was 100 ms before, or to where the last scroll stroke left it if a finger lifted under 500 ms ago. ⛔ Ignoring any one-report step over 120 units was tried first and cut the fastest flicks short, whose real steps reached 188; the limit stays, at 300. Each landing logs the first finger's last ten positions and what the cursor was put back by. | `f378794`, `245eae5` |
| 2026-09-30 | After a two-finger scroll, the finger left on the pad moves the cursor again without both lifting. It takes over once it has rested 30 ms and then moves, or after 150 ms if it is still sliding, so the slide as a scroll ends (measured at up to 113 ms and 588 px) still moves nothing. ⚠️ Only if the scroll had stopped before the other finger lifted: the fingers' midpoint moved under 30 units in the 100 ms before, or the scroll never sent the wheel. Lifted mid-stroke, the finger left behind holds until every finger is up or the next stroke lands, which is what holding one finger and scrolling with the other needs on an Edge, whose held finger is reported sliding toward the hovering one. | `2176f85`, `245eae5`, `ab45853` |
| 2026-09-30 | Double taps land on one pixel. Windows makes a double-click only from two clicks within about 2 pixels. A tap whose roll moved the cursor was put back and clicked at once, while the roll's last movement was still queued for Windows, so the click could land a few pixels off: 31 of 36 double taps on an Edge had such a tap. That click now waits 30 ms for the put-back to settle, and a second tap within 500 ms and 16 px of a first clicks exactly on it. | `ab45853` |
| 2026-10-01 | The TV can ask for the settings window on a bridged device. Added message type `MsgOpenConfig = 14`, sent by the TV app's streaming overlay on that device's own connection; the listener opens the window on that device's tab, which is what it already does by itself when a device is bridged. It serves any device that can be bridged: the chord that opens the window is read off a touchpad, so a device without one had no way to ask. The window is opened on a thread of its own, never on the session's read loop, where the wait for an old window to close would hold up the device's reports; and a request that finds the window already in front is logged and does nothing. `MsgAudioHold = 13` is listed as well, so the list matches the TV's. | `442b374` |
| 2026-10-01 | The settings page's Simple view rotates its footer line through ten hints instead of repeating one, a new one every 30 seconds; a click goes to the next, and the pointer resting on a hint holds it. The first is the old line, how to bring the window back, which still leads on every open. Among the rest: where a bridged controller's name comes from, that the window opens whenever a device is bridged, and that Quick is the view for switching configs mid-game. Page 2.66.31 to 2.66.34. | `3672953`, `827ec91`, `f9016aa`, `f014c3b`, `5752efb` |
| 2026-10-01 | A pad button can be remapped to another pad button. The rebind list ends with seventeen pad targets, shown as buttons (`pad: ○ / B`) rather than by the names behind them, and Cross set to Circle with Circle set to Cross exchanges the two rather than leaving both as one. Page 2.66.25. ⚠️ The touchpad's tap and press as remap sources are not part of this. | `a5e77b0`, `66f3b28`, `d296398` |
| 2026-10-01 | A settings window resized by dragging its edges comes back at that size. The saved size was an index into a table of presets, so a dragged size had nowhere to be kept; it is now stored per view in `window-state.txt` as a share of the work area, and dropped when a preset is chosen or the view is switched. A window that is minimised when it closes is read as the rectangle it will come back to, not as the stub Windows parks off screen, which had been stored as a size of 160x28 and a place in the corner. ⚠️ A window snapped to half the screen measures a few pixels more than the work area, so its size is kept while the listener runs and refused at the next start. | `957d5ca`, `33a3452` |
| 2026-10-01 | `create-desktop-shortcut.bat` in the release folder puts a DS5-USBIP shortcut on the desktop, built from the folder's own absolute path and carrying the exe's icon. A Windows shortcut cannot follow a folder that moves, so the README says to move the folder first and run it again afterwards. | `c0d75cf` |
| 2026-10-01 | The exe's icon is a black bridge on the original blue backdrop, generated by `installer/make-icon-ds5.ps1` from upstream's untouched master; its `-Check` rebuilds the icon in memory and compares it with the committed file. The tray icon and the settings window's icon are the listener's own. The tray loads it at the small-icon size. The page is served it as its favicon, which reaches the title bar; a browser stretches a favicon for anything bigger, so the listener sets the window's big and small icons itself, at the pixel sizes of the display the window is on, and puts them back when the browser replaces them. The icon carries a frame for every stock display scale from 100% to 300%, 15 sizes. | `3c4b980`, `d5708e8`, `8dadb95`, `79e0050` |
| 2026-10-01 | The tray menu's Exit is Quit. It closes the settings window and removes the tray icon at once, then stops the listener as before, so bridged controllers are still torn down properly. The same two things happen at the end of the agent's loop, so Ctrl+C and a closed console leave neither behind. A second start of the listener while one is running raises the settings window and ends without a tray icon of its own; it used to start one first, and 1 start in 5 left it behind. The synthetic mouse and keyboard are stopped on the way out: their pump threads were never joined, so every orderly end of the program after a controller had been bridged was `abort()`, a "Debug Error!" box with the process still alive behind it. | `80f9318`, `ef8e2ae`, `5d82095`, `d126945`, `a593d80`, `6681dba` |
| 2026-10-01 | The listener starts in the background, with no terminal window. `start-ctm-usbip.bat` and the desktop shortcut start it through `conhost.exe --headless`, Windows' console host told to show no window; the .bat ends at once, and Quit on the tray icon is how the listener is closed. ⚠️ A failed start is silent: no tray icon appears, and the reason is in `device.log`. `--headless` is not a documented switch. | `4171722` |
| 2026-10-02 | The touchpad's tap, two-finger tap and press take anything a button's remap takes: a mouse action, a keyboard key, a button on the pad, an on-screen keyboard or a turn of the wheel. A tapped key is down for 60 ms and comes back up by the keyboard's own pump, never by the pad's next report; a tapped pad button rides in the pad's reports for 60 ms; the pad pressed in holds a key or a button until the last finger leaves, as it holds a drag. Only the mouse actions run while the pad is driving the settings page. The three rows on the page carry the remap picker. Page 2.66.36. | `4ab166e`, `bde7969`, `109c152` |
| 2026-10-02 | The exe starts by itself, and `start-ctm-usbip.bat` is gone. It is a Windows program, so nothing opens a terminal for it: double-clicked, or from a shortcut straight to it, it is `agent --ui`; typed into a terminal it borrows that terminal's console, and with no arguments there it still prints the usage. Its folder is found from the exe rather than from where it was started: the exe's own folder when the profiles are beside it, the checkout that a build's `home-folder.txt` names, or `--home <folder>`. If the profiles are missing it says so, in a message box when nobody is reading its output, and does not start. Closing the terminal a listener was typed into stops it properly, as Ctrl+C always had. `release.ps1` keeps what a person had in the release folder: the old folder is set aside, the new one is staged and zipped clean, and everything the release does not ship is moved back afterwards; it refuses to run while the listener is running from that folder. | `34ac43e`, `c2ec6c9`, `23c0070`, `fa5b048`, `d683622`, `306801d` |
| 2026-10-02 | The Simple view's hints say what the tray icon is for. A new one, shown second: DS5-USBIP keeps running in the background when the window is closed, and Quit on the tray icon stops it. The two hints that already named the icon said it two ways, and both say "click the tray icon" now. Eleven hints. The tray icon's tooltip showed three wrong characters where a long dash had been written, because the file has no byte-order mark and the build did not say its sources were UTF-8; the tooltip is plain text now, and both projects build with `/utf-8`. Page 2.66.37. | `92e82fc`, `d6a8655`, `84337a5` |
| 2026-10-02 | The tray icon's menu has a title, a list of controllers and the window's layout. The title is DS5-USBIP in a larger bold face with the number of controllers connected under it, and clicking it closes the menu. Controllers opens a side menu with a line for each bridged device (its nickname, what it is, USB or Bluetooth, and its battery where it reports one); choosing a line opens the settings window on that controller. Config Mode opens a side menu with Advanced, Simple and Quick and a padlock on the one in use; choosing one changes the window's layout. `Open settings` is now `Open Controller Config`, and `Show keyboard` is `Open Virtual Keyboard`, which reads `Close Virtual Keyboard` while it is open. The devices API gives each device a `label` ("DualSense (BT)"), and the page shows that instead of working it out. Page 2.66.38. | `9e677ee`, `10d68ee`, `c0e15fb` |
| 2026-10-02 | In the settings page's Advanced view the Mode picker opens on top of the notices. It lives in the footer, which was drawn under the notice strip just above it, so the list it unrolls upward went behind any notice that was up; while the list is open the footer is raised with it, and put back as it closes. A controller with no config shows no section strip: picking (no config), or Unlink, emptied the settings and left the strip of section names standing. The Overview's small version label, which had stayed at 2.66.4 since 2026-09-19, reads the page's version again. Page 2.66.39. | `1a15c93`, `9e87016`, `72b382b` |
| 2026-10-02 | The settings window says "device" where it said "controller", and a mark says what each device is: a pad, a keyboard or a mouse, as colour emoji, from the type the listener reads off the device's own descriptor. A DualSense, DS4 or Xbox pad from a listener too old to send the type is still a pad, and a device that says none of the three gets no mark. Page 2.66.42. | `83a9bba`, `a596f57`, `9c49dcb` |
| 2026-10-02 | One tab and one row per device in the settings window, not one per part: parts the listener names alike are one device, with every kind they are in its marks (a receiver reads as keyboard and mouse) and every part's battery gauge, and a config set on its tab goes to every part that takes one. The marks follow the model name on the tab, in the rows and under Simple's and Quick's big name. The carousel's keys and Quick's legend name the input in hand (L1/R1, LB/RB or Q/E). Quick is half as wide again, at the width it was dragged to, in the listener's sizes and the page's own. A device with no serial reads "(no serial - auto_link disabled)", and one that takes no config "Configs can only be set for controllers." Page 2.66.50. | `c1c993e`, `320d6ea`, `d44bb1c`, `949a22e`, `a8174a0`, `4975c09`, `db67bff`, `b952a85` |
| 2026-10-02 | Advanced cycles two window sizes, as Simple and Quick do: the smallest is gone, it did not work at 250% scaling, and a saved size from before is moved down one so the window opens where it was. Circle in Quick goes to Close rather than closing, as in Simple, and Circle or Escape in Advanced lands on Close in the footer. Down from Quick's auto link button lands on Close and up from Close on it; down from Simple's config picker lands on New. Page 2.66.51. | `4f286b6` |
| 2026-10-02 | The tray icon's menu counts and lists devices, not their parts: the parts under one nickname are one device, as on the settings page's tabs, so four devices in ten parts read "4 devices connected" and are four lines. The side menu is "Devices", and a line leads with the device's name: "DualSense (USB) - Token - 100%". The title picture is never narrower than the menu's widest line; narrower, Windows drew it without its transparency, a black box. | `b9cb386`, `68e08dc`, `0d5bf94` |
| 2026-10-03 | The on-screen keyboard's sub-compact face is laid out for a controller: ten equal columns with no gaps, backspace and space side by side wearing the face button that does their job, and a fn layer with F1 to F12, the 22 symbols near where a full keyboard has them around enter, esc, tab, page up and down, del, home and copy. The legend and the button marks follow the pad that pressed last; opening the config window no longer closes the keyboard; paste and copy work from the pad; and the keyboard remembers its face, size and place. The settings page's Simple footer has a twelfth hint and three reworded, names the pad's buttons by their symbols, and its hint 8 follows the input in use. | `d57a9cf`, `5be42f5`, `9247539`, `99326a0`, `136b9ce`, `64270bc`, `f7366d7`, `2ad911f`, `10296d4`, `9f53768`, `41f4ece` |
| 2026-10-03 | The settings page's footer counts devices, not their parts, as the tabs do: a receiver of three parts is one device, so the footer reads "3 devices bridged". In Advanced the Mode picker and Close stay at the right edge at every window width, with "controllers -> game" beside them; they wrapped to the left before. Page 2.66.55. | `a022171`, `1858a10` |
| 2026-10-03 | When a full-screen game takes the front back from the settings window just raised over it, the listener raises it again: up to three times within two seconds, and only while the front is the window it was taken from, so a click elsewhere or Alt+Tab is left alone. The log names the program that had the front. In The Witcher 3 the pad chord needed two or three presses before. | `e0fff4d` |
| 2026-10-03 | The gyro can move the right stick, for a game that drops a held button whenever a mouse moves: the stick moves by how fast the controller is turning, added to wherever the thumb has it and held at the ends, as artzox's DS5Dongle does, with gyro-to-mouse's gate and motion filter underneath. Settings `gyro_to_stick_gate_type` and `gyro_to_stick_gate_button` (the mouse's choices), `gyro_stick_sens`, `gyro_stick_sens_v`, `gyro_stick_axis` and `gyro_stick_invert`, and the preset `gyro-to-stick-on-L2-aiming` after its mouse twin. Page 2.66.56. | `e7996e3` |
| 2026-10-04 | The window is "Controller Configs": "config" named the window, the saved set a controller is linked to and the folder at once, so a config stays a config and the window is named for the configs it holds. Its title ("DS5-USBIP Controller Configs"), the tray's "Open Controller Configs", Simple's heading, the hints and the confirm box say so, the tray's layout side menu is "Window Mode" (it was "Config Mode"), and the tray tip reads "DS5-USBIP: Select Devices, Controller Configs, Virtual Keyboard or Quit". Page 2.66.57. | `6515409` |
| 2026-10-05 | What the window says when DS5-USBIP does not answer is true again: start it from its desktop shortcut or a double-click, or wait if it is restarting, as Controller Configs comes back by itself. Gone: the command lines to type, the --rest switch it now turns on by itself, the address field the window does not show, and the firewall. Advanced says it once (the early warning gives way to the cover and stays gone), Simple and Quick lose their command line, and the footer and the log say "listener" where they said "agent". The README in the zip names Controller Configs and lists every file the listener creates beside itself. Page 2.66.59. | `0778b81`, `69b1370` |
